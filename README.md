To launch the project and download the prerequisties the best solution is to work in a virtual environment.

Once you have downloaded it, create your environment.
Go to the source of the project.
Run the following command :
```bash
virtualenv virtual
virtual\Scripts\activate
```
Once you are in your environment you can install the dependencies.
To do so just run : 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Wait and congrats your dependencies were successfully installed.
You can now run manage.py.
